# Summary

> Brief description of the feature.

# Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
> outcome?

# Basic Example

> If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.
> Omit this section if it's not applicable.
> 
> Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
> the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
> enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
> closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Design Summary

> Summarize the approach of the feature design in a couple of sentences. Call out
> any known patterns or best practices the design is based around.

# Detailed Design

> This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
> familiar with cdk8s to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
> implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
> and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
> defined here.
> 
> Include any diagrams and/or visualizations that help to demonstrate the design.
> Here are some tools that we often use:
> 
> - [Graphviz](http://graphviz.it/#/gallery/structs.gv)
> - [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com)

# Drawbacks

> Why should we _not_ do this? Please consider:
> 
> - implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
> - whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
> - the impact on teaching people how to use cdk8s
> - integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
> - cost of migrating existing cdk8s applications (is it a breaking change?)
> 
> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Rationale and Alternatives

> - Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
> - What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
>   choosing them?
> - What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption Strategy

> If we implement this proposal, how will existing cdk8s developers adopt it? Is
> this a breaking change? How can we assist in adoption?

# Unresolved questions

> - What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
>   before this gets merged?
> - What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
>   of this feature before stabilization?
> - What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
>   addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
>   RFC?

# Future Possibilities

> Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be
> and how it would affect cdk8s as whole. Try to use this section as a tool to
> more
> fully consider all possible interactions with the project and ecosystem in your
> proposal. Also consider how this fits into the roadmap for the project.
> 
> This is a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you
> are writing but are otherwise related.
> 
> If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply
> state that you cannot think of anything.
