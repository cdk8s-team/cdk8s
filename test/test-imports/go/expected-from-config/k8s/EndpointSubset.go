// EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports.
//
// The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:
// {
// Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
// Ports:     [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
// }
// The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:
// a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],
// b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
