// TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.
type TopologySpreadConstraint struct {
	// MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
	//
	// It's the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in any two topology domains of a given topology type. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |   P   |   P   |       | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.
	MaxSkew *float64 `field:"required" json:"maxSkew" yaml:"maxSkew"`
	// TopologyKey is the key of node labels.
	//
	// Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.
	TopologyKey *string `field:"required" json:"topologyKey" yaml:"topologyKey"`
	// WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint.
	//
	// - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it It's considered as "Unsatisfiable" if and only if placing incoming pod on any topology violates "MaxSkew". For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.
	WhenUnsatisfiable *string `field:"required" json:"whenUnsatisfiable" yaml:"whenUnsatisfiable"`
	// LabelSelector is used to find matching pods.
	//
	// Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.
