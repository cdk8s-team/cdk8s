![Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/beta-informational.svg?style=for-the-badge)

**cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes applications.
Built on top of the auto generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a hand crafted *construct*
for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.
