# cdk8s+ (cdk8s-plus)

> High level abstractions on top [cdk8s](../cdk8s).

**cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level abstractions for authoring kuberenetes applications.

Built on top of the auto generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a hand crafted *construct* for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.

**You should not use this library in production environments.**
