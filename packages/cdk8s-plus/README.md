# cdk8s+ (cdk8s-plus)

**cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level abstractions for authoring kuberenetes applications. Built on top of the auto generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a hand crafted *construct* for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.

> **You should not use this library in production environments.**<br><br>
> ![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/experimental-important.svg?style=for-the-badge)<br><br>
> This library is in very early stages of development, as such, and in correspondence with a `0.x` semantic major version line, its `API` is likely to rapidly change in breaking ways. We therefore highly discourage using this library in production workloads.

## Letter Of Intent

We strive to develop this library with full transparency and as much community feedback and contributions as possible. To that end, we publish this development version. We acknowledge it might be lacking substantial capabilities, and is currently focused around experimentation and gathering feedback.

## In Depth

### `Container`

Define containers that run in a pod using the `Container` class.

#### Environment variables

Environment variables can be added to containers using various sources, via semantically explicit API's:

```typescript
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus'

const container = new kplus.Container({
  image: 'my-app'
})

// explicitly use a value.
container.addEnv('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromValue('value'));

// use a specific key from a config map.
const backendsConfig = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName('backends');
container.addEnv('endpoint', kplus.EnvValue.fromConfigMap(backendsConfig, 'endpoint'));

// use a specific key from a secret.
const credentials = kplus.Secret.fromSecretName('credentials');
container.addEnv('password', kplus.EnvValue.fromSecret(credentials, 'password'));
```

#### Volume Mounts

A very common capability is to mount a volume with some data onto a container. Using pure kubernetes API, this would require writing something like:

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: main
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /path/to/mount
          name: 'config-volume'
  volumes:
    - name: 'config-volume'
      configMap:
        name: 'config'
```

Notice the apparent redundancy of having to specify the volume name twice, once in the container definition and one in the volumes. Also, if you happen to need the same mount in other pods, you would need to duplicate this configuration. This can get complex and cluttered very fast. In contrast, here is how to do this with `cdk8s+`:

```typescript
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus';

const config = kplus.ConfigMap.fromConfigMapName('config');
const volume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(config);

const container = new kplus.Container({
  image: 'my-app'
})

// Cool alert: every pod that will later be configured with this container,
// will automatically have access to this volume, so you don't need to explicitly add it to the pod spec!.
container.mount('/path/to/mount', volume);
```
