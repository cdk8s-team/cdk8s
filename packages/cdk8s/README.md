# cdk8s

> Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

This library is the foundation of **cdk8s**. It includes base types that are
used to define cdk8s applications.

## Chart

The `Chart` is a container that synthesizes a single Kubernetes manifest.

```ts
class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, ns: string) {
    super(scope, ns);

    // add contents here
  }
}
```

During synthesis, charts collect all the `ApiObject` nodes (recursively) and
emit a single YAML manifest that includes all these objects.

## ApiObject

An `ApiObject` is a construct that represents an entry in a Kubernetes manifest.
In most cases, you won't use `ApiObject` directly but rather use classes that
are generated by the cdk8s CLI and extend this base class.


## Include

The `Include` construct can be used to include an existing manifest in a chart.

The following example will include the Kubernetes Dashboard in `MyChart`:

```ts
import { Include } from 'cdk8s';

class MyChart extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string) {
    super(scope, id);

    const dashboard = new Include(this, 'dashboard', {
      url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml',
      // or
      url: 'dashboard.yaml'
    });

    // ...other resources
  }
}
```

All API objects defined in the included manifest will be added as children
`ApiObject`s under the `Include` construct's scope. This implies that you can
use `Node.of(include).children` to inspect them.

The following example queries for all the `Deployment` resources in the
dashboard:

```ts
const deps = Node.of(dashboard)
  .children
  .filter((c: ApiObject) => c.kind === 'Deployment');
```

NOTE: names of included objects (`metadata.name`) are preserved. This means that
if you try to include the same manifest twice into the same chart, your manifest
will have duplicate definitions of the same objects.

### Testing

cdk8s bundles a set of test utilities under the `Testing` class:

* `Testing.app()` returns an `App` object bound to a temporary output directory.
* `Testing.synth(chart)` returns the Kubernetes manifest synthesized from a
  chart.
