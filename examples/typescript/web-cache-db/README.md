This example is a demonstration of cdk8s-plus capabilities for authoring complex Kubernetes applications.

It shows how to:

- Schedule pods on specific nodes based on labels.
- Spread pod replicas to be deployed on different nodes.
- Colocate pods to be scheduled on the same node.
- Allow only specific network communication between pods.
- Grant RBAC permissions to manage resources for specific groups.
