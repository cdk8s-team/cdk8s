# Web Service Construct Example (in Go!)

This example application deploys [hello-kubernetes](https://github.com/paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes) and [ghost](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/) by using a custom WebService construct with cdk8s.

You can apply this example into your own cluster with these step by step commands:

#### Import

```console
$ cdk8s import --language go
```

#### Synthesize the CDK into a k8s template
```console
$ cdk8s synth
```

#### Apply the k8s template to your cluster
```console
$ kubectl apply -f dist/web-service-go.k8s.yaml
```
