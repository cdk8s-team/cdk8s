# Hello helm (java!)

This example application deploys [bitnami/redis](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis) Helm chart with sentinel containers enabled.

Before running this, you will need to make sure you have `helm` downloaded and that you have added the Bitnami helm repo using: `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
