This input to this expression would have the following fields:\n\n    device.driver\n    device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"].model\n    device.attributes[\"ext.example.com\"].family\n    device.capacity[\"dra.example.com\"].modules\n\nThe device.driver field can be used to check for a specific driver, either as a high-level precondition (i.e. you only want to consider devices from this driver) or as part of a multi-clause expression that is meant to consider devices from different drivers.\n\nThe value type of each attribute is defined by the device definition, and users who write these expressions must consult the documentation for their specific drivers. The value type of each capacity is Quantity.\n\nIf an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned. Any reference to an unknown field will cause an evaluation error and allocation to abort.\n\nA robust expression should check for the existence of attributes before referencing them.\n\nFor ease of use, the cel.bind() function is enabled, and can be used to simplify expressions that access multiple attributes with the same domain. For example:\n\n    cel.bind(dra, device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"], dra.someBool && dra.anotherBool)\n\nThe length of the expression must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki.

          "description": "Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.\n\nKubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume source in its spec.\n\nKubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt timestamp.\n\nKubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and certificateChainPath fields.\n\nThe credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically, signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).\n\nPrefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath, your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are consistent.\n\nThe named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to use the certificates it issues.",

This input to this expression would have the following fields:\n\n    device.driver\n    device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"].model\n    device.attributes[\"ext.example.com\"].family\n    device.capacity[\"dra.example.com\"].modules\n\nThe device.driver field can be used to check for a specific driver, either as a high-level precondition (i.e. you only want to consider devices from this driver) or as part of a multi-clause expression that is meant to consider devices from different drivers.\n\nThe value type of each attribute is defined by the device definition, and users who write these expressions must consult the documentation for their specific drivers. The value type of each capacity is Quantity.\n\nIf an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned. Any reference to an unknown field will cause an evaluation error and allocation to abort.\n\nA robust expression should check for the existence of attributes before referencing them.\n\nFor ease of use, the cel.bind() function is enabled, and can be used to simplify expressions that access multiple attributes with the same domain. For example:\n\n    cel.bind(dra, device.attributes[\"dra.example.com\"], dra.someBool && dra.anotherBool)\n\nThe length of the expression must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki.

The value type of each capacity is Quantity.\n\nIf an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned.

The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {\"rule\": \"self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired\"}\n\nIf the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {\"rule\": \"self.components['Widget'].priority < 10\"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {\"rule\": \"self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)\"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {\"rule\": \"self.startsWith('kube')\"}\n\nThe `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.\n\nUnknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an \"unknown type\". An \"unknown type\" is recursively defined as:\n  - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true\n  - An array where the items schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n  - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an \"unknown type\"\n\nOnly property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:\n\t  \"true\", \"false\", \"null\", \"in\", \"as\", \"break\", \"const\", \"continue\", \"else\", \"for\", \"function\", \"if\",\n\t  \"import\", \"let\", \"loop\", \"package\", \"namespace\", \"return\".\nExamples:\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"namespace\": {\"rule\": \"self.__namespace__ > 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"x-prop\": {\"rule\": \"self.x__dash__prop > 0\"}\n  - Rule accessing a property named \"redact__d\": {\"rule\": \"self.redact__underscores__d > 0\"}\n\nEquality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:\n  - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and\n    non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.\n  - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values\n    are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with\n    non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.\n\nIf `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`.\n\nBy default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional\n variable whose value() is the same type as `self`.\nSee the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details.\n\nTransition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true."
