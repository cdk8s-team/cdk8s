  section1:
    title: Why should you use CDK for Kubernetes?
    subtitle: |
      **Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes** (cdk8s) is a software development
      framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions
      using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs. cdk8s
      generates pure Kubernetes YAML - you can use it to define applications for
      any Kubernetes cluster running anywhere.

      text: |
        You can use **cdk8s** to define applications for any Kubernetes cluster
        running anywhere, including any cloud or on-premises. cdk8s runs locally
        in your development environment and produces standard Kubernetes YAML
        that can be applied to any cluster.

    - title: Supports any API version and custom resources
      icon: laptop-cloud
      text: |
        You can import any Kubernetes API version and custom resource
        definitions to use with **cdk8s**. This makes it easy to use cdk8s to easily
        write entire Kubernetes applications and keep them up to date as
        applications change.

      text: |
        **cdk8s** lets you define applications using Typescript, JavaScript,
        and Python. Support for more languages, including Go is coming soon.

      text: |
        **cdk8s** works great with a [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) workflow, making it easy
        to see changes as you modify your configuration and between API
        versions. Simply use the cdk8s to synthesize new YAML configuration
        files and commit them to your git repo.

      text: |
        We are building **cdk8s** for any developer who uses Kubernetes to
        define their applications.  We encourage contributions of any type, from
        fixing typos to building new features. Our goal is that cdk8s becomes an
        official CNCF sandbox project that the entire community can use.
