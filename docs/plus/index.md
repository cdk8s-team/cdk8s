# Overview

**cdk8s+** is a library with high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes
applications.

Built on top of the auto-generated building blocks provided by CDK8s, this
library includes a hand crafted *construct* for each native kubernetes object,
exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.

!!! notice
    **cdk8s+** is currently built on top of version [1.17.0](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubernetes-json-schema/tree/master/v1.17.0) of the kubernetes API specifications.
    If you are deploying manifests produced by `cdk8s+` onto clusters of a lower version, you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid manifests.

    > See [Supporting various k8s API specs](https://github.com/awslabs/cdk8s/issues/299) for more details and progress on this issue.

## At a glance

```typescript
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as path from 'path';

// our cdk app
const app = new cdk8s.App();

// our kuberentes chart
const chart = new cdk8s.Chart(app, 'my-chart');

// lets create a volume that contains our app.
// we use a trick with a config map!
const appData = new kplus.ConfigMap(chart, 'AppData');
appData.addDirectory(path.join(__dirname, 'app'));

const appVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(appData);

// lets create a deployment to run a few instances of a pod
const deployment = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Deployment', {
  replicas: 3,
});

// now we create a container that runs our app
const appPath = '/var/lib/app';
const port = 80;
const container = deployment.addContainer({
  image: 'node:14.4.0-alpine3.12',
  command: ['node', 'index.js', `${port}`],
  port: port,
  workingDir: appPath,
});

// make the app accessible to the container
container.mount(appPath, appVolume);

// finally, we expose the deployment as a load balancer service and make it run
deployment.expose(8080, {serviceType: kplus.ServiceType.LOAD_BALANCER})

// we are done, synth
app.synth();
```

## Getting Started

=== "TypeScript/JavaScript"

    `❯ npm install cdk8s-plus cdk8s`

    ```typescript
    import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus';
    import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

    const app = new cdk8s.App();
    const chart = new cdk8s.Chart(app, 'Chart');

    new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Deployment', {
      replicas: 3,
      containers: [{
        image: 'ubuntu',
      }],
    });
    ```

=== "Python"

    `❯ pip install cdk8s-plus cdk8s`

    ```python
    import cdk8s_plus as kplus
    import cdk8s

    app = cdk8s.App()
    chart = cdk8s.Chart(app, 'Chart')

    kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Deployment',
      replicas=1,
      containers=[kplus.Container(image='ubuntu')]
    )
    ```
