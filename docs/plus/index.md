# cdk8s+

**cdk8s+** is a library with high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes
applications.

Built on top of the auto-generated building blocks provided by cdk8s, this
library includes a hand crafted *construct* for each native kubernetes object,
exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.

!!! info

    The documentation here relates to version `2.x` of the cdk8s toolchain, which is the latest. If you are still using version `1.x`, please refer to the [Migrating from 1.x Guide](../migrating-from-1.x.md).

Here is an example of how we would deploy a simple nginx container, once with the low-level API (on the left), and once with the high level abstraction (on the right).

### Spec compatibility

**cdk8s+** is vended as a separate library for each kubernetes spec version. Follow the pane on the left to navigate to the appropriate version you need.
Per kubernetes [compatibility guarantees](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning), **stable** resources in a `cdk8s-plus-XX` library are compatible with
any spec version higher or equal to `1.XX.0`. **Non-stable** resources are not guaranteed to be compatible, as they may be removed in future spec versions.

!!! notice

    cdk8s+ libraries are maintained only for the 3 latest Kubernetes releases. So, if the latest Kubernetes release is N, `cdk8s-plus-N`, `cdk8s-plus-(N-1)` and `cdk8s-plus-(N-2)` will be continously updated
    and supported. However, `cdk8s-plus-(N-3)` and so on will no longer be actively maintained.

### Naming conventions

- Stable resources are represented by a *construct* of the same *kind*. For example, the `io.k8s.api.core.v1.Pod` resource maps to the `Pod` *construct*.
- Non stable resources are suffixed with their *api version*. For example, the `io.k8s.api.networking.v1beta1.Ingress` maps to the `IngressV1Beta1` *construct*.

## FAQ

### I operate Kubernetes version `1.XX` - which cdk8s+ library should I be using?

If there is a `cdk8s-plus-XX` library that matches your target Kubernetes
version, we recommend using it since all Kubernetes manifests generated using it
will be compatible.

If there is not a matching `cdk8s-plus-XX` library, we recommend using the
closest matching version. The manifests generated by `cdk8s-plus-XX` may also
work for older versions of Kubernetes, but you might encounter some unsupported
spec properties or invalid manifests.

### I'm using `cdk8s-plus-XX` - which kubernetes versions will my manifest work on?

If you are using stable APIs (those that are not in alpha or beta), manifests
generated in `cdk8s-plus-XX` will work in Kubernetes versions `1.XX.0` and
above. Unstable APIs (which are always labeled in cdk8s+ using a suffix, e.g.
`IngressV1Beta1`) may work in newer versions of Kubernetes, but it is also
possible they have been removed.

The manifests generated by `cdk8s-plus-XX` may also work for older versions of
Kubernetes, but you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid
manifests.

## At a glance

```typescript
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';
import * as path from 'path';

// our cdk app
const app = new cdk8s.App();

// our kubernetes chart
const chart = new cdk8s.Chart(app, 'my-chart');

// lets create a volume that contains our app.
// we use a trick with a config map!
const appData = new kplus.ConfigMap(chart, 'AppData');
appData.addDirectory(path.join(__dirname, 'app'));

const appVolume = kplus.Volume.fromConfigMap(appData);

// lets create a deployment to run a few instances of a pod
const deployment = new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Deployment', {
  replicas: 3,
});

// now we create a container that runs our app
const appPath = '/var/lib/app';
const port = 80;
const container = deployment.addContainer({
  image: 'node:14.4.0-alpine3.12',
  command: ['node', 'index.js', `${port}`],
  port: port,
  workingDir: appPath,
});

// make the app accessible to the container
container.mount(appPath, appVolume);

// finally, we expose the deployment as a load balancer service and make it run
deployment.exposeViaService({ serviceType: kplus.ServiceType.LOAD_BALANCER });

// we are done, synth
app.synth();
```

## Overcoming Coverage Gaps

As mentioned, the APIs offered by **cdk8s+** are hand-written by the team as well as the community.
As such, you might encounter coverage gaps from time to time; that is, you are trying to configure
something but the API doesn't expose it. There are two kinds of gaps:

### Missing Resource

When an entire resource is missing, you can supplement it by dropping to the L1 layer of constructs,
which are available from within **cdk8s+**, so you don't need to install an additional library,
or [import](https://cdk8s.io/docs/latest/cli/import/) any resources. For example:

```ts
import * as kplus from 'cdk8s-plus-26';
import * as cdk8s from 'cdk8s';

const app = new cdk8s.App();
const chart = new cdk8s.Chart(app, 'Chart');

// a Deployment exists as a higher level objects,
// so we use it.
new kplus.Deployment(chart, 'Deployment', {
  replicas: 3,
  containers: [{
    image: 'ubuntu',
  }],
});

// a StorageClass doesn't, so we use the low level objects.
// notice the '.k8s.' addition.
new kplus.k8s.KubeStorageClass(chart, 'StorageClass', {
  provisioner: 'kubernetes.io/aws-ebs'
});

app.synth();
```

### Missing Property
