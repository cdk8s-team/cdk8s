# Command Line Interface (CLI)

cdk8s is shipped with a command-line interface called `cdk8s` which can be used
to work with cdk8s apps.

The CLI is not required to use cdk8s but it includes some useful utilities.

!!! info

    The documentation here relates to version `2.x` of the cdk8s toolchain, which is the latest. If you are still using version `1.x`, please refer to the [Migrating from 1.x Guide](../migrating-from-1.x.md).
