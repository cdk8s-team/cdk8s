# cdk8s-cli

**cdk8s** is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes
applications using rich object-oriented APIs. It allows developers to leverage
the full power of software in order to define abstract components called
"constructs" which compose Kubernetes resources or other constructs into
higher-level abstractions.

To install the CLI use one of the following methods:

=== "Homebrew"
    `brew install cdk8s`

=== "npm"
    `npm i -g cdk8s-cli`

=== "yarn"
    `yarn global add cdk8s-cli`

## init

This command creates new cdk8s projects from built-in templates:

```shell
$ cdk8s init TEMPLATE
```

The following example will create a new TypeScript app project:

```shell
$ mkdir my-fun-little-project
$ cd my-fun-little-project
$ cdk8s init typescript-app
```

## import

The `import` command generates constructs for Kubernetes objects.

### Kubernetes API

To generate constructs for all Kubernetes API objects of a certain version, use:

```shell
$ cdk8s import k8s
```

The import command will generate files under `imports/k8s.ts` with constructs for each API object in the Kubernetes spec.

#### Specifying Kubernetes version

Use the `@version` notation to import a specific Kubernetes version:

```shell
$ cdk8s import k8s@1.16.0
```

Alternatively, you can specify your `k8s` import in the `cdk8s.yaml` config file:

```yaml
imports:
  - k8s@1.17.0
```

#### Selecting `apiVersion`s for specific objects

By default, the command `cdk8s import k8s` will use the latest stable version of k8s objects.

For example, when using k8s 1.17, if you want to use `DeploymentSpec`, you would be importing it from [Deployment v1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.17/#deploymentspec-v1-apps) by default. 

In the default `v1`, the `revisionHistoryLimit`, which is the number of old ReplicaSets to retain, is set to 10 by default. You would have to explicitly set this to a higher number if you want to retain more.

Let's say that you want the behavior of [extensions/v1beta1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.17/#deploymentspec-v1beta1-extensions), which defaults to retaining _all_ old ReplicaSets.

To do this, you could add the `--include` flag to your `cdk8s import`. Here is how that would look:

From the CLI:

```code
cdk8s import k8s --language typescript --include io.k8s.api.extensions.v1beta1.Deployment
```

Here we are explicitly choosing to use the [Deployment extensions/v1beta1](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.17/#deployment-v1beta1-extensions) version, which includes the new default behavior that we want from `DeploymentSpec`

> This feature is not yet supported in `cdk8s.yaml` config.

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

You can import CRDs from local files or URLs:

```shell
$ cdk8s import my_crd.yaml
```

Or from `cdk8s.yaml`:

```yaml
imports:
  - my_crd.yaml
```

A CRD with group `mygroup.io` and kind `Foo` will be imported to the following locations:

- TypeScript: `imports/mygroup.io/foo.ts`
- Python: `imports/mygroup/io/foo/__init__.py`

If the imported YAML is a `List` of CRDs, all these CRDs will be imported. This
is useful, for example, to import all the CRDs from a running cluster:

```shell
kubectl get crds -o json | cdk8s import /dev/stdin
```

> Yes, this works!

### Override default behavior of import naming

Note: this is not yet supported for python.

You can also override the default behavior for `cdk8s` importing. This will be helpful to you if you would like to name your CRD imports differently from their kind. Here is how you do it:

`cdk8s` CLI

```code
cdk8s import example:=my_crd.yaml
```

`cdk8s.yaml` Config

```yaml
imports:
  - example:=my_crd.yaml
```

If your CRD contained two kinds, `cluster` and `autoscaler`, you would have two imports. You could use them in this fashion:


Typescript:

```javascript
import { cluster } from './imports/example-cluster';
import { autoscaler } from './imports/example-autoscaler';
```

Python:

```python
not yet supported
```

## Selecting language

You can specify your desired language with the `--language` flag. For example:

`cdk8s` CLI

```code
cdk8s import --language typescript
```

`cdk8s.yaml` Config

```yaml
language: typescript
```

Both `typescript` and `python` are supported right now, unless noted otherwise.
