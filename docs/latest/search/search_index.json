Creating a new cdk8s project in one of the supported programming languages. Define & deploy your first cdk8s application. Define a custom cdk8s construct. Install the CLI \u00b6 cdk8s has a cute little CLI that has a few useful commands. Let\u2019s start by installing the cdk8s CLI globally. We have three options for this. Homebrew brew install cdk8s npm npm install -g cdk8s-cli yarn yarn global add cdk8s-cli Prerequisites \u00b6 Set up pre-requisites based on the language you wish to write your cdk8s code in. TypeScript Node.js >= 12.13.0 Your favorite editor/IDE yarn (optional) Python Python >= 3.7.7 pipenv version 2018.11.26 or above. Your favorite editor/IDE Java Maven >= 3.6.3 Your favorite editor/IDE Go Go >= 1.16 Your favorite editor/IDE Info This Getting Started guide will help you create a Kubernetes manifest using your preferred programming language. You do not need access to a Kubernetes cluster in order to produce a manifests using cdk8s. New Project \u00b6 Now, we\u2019ll use the cdk8s init command to create a new cdk8s app: TypeScript $ mkdir hello $ cd hello $ cdk8s init typescript-app Initializing a project from the typescript-app template ... Python $ mkdir hello $ cd hello $ cdk8s init python-app Initializing a project from the python-app template ... Java $ mkdir hello $ cd hello $ cdk8s init java-app Initializing a project from the java-app template ... Go $ mkdir hello $ cd hello $ cdk8s init go-app Initializing a project from the go-app template This will perform the following: Create a new project directory Install cdk8s as a dependency Import all Kubernetes API objects Apps & Charts \u00b6 Apps are structured as a tree of constructs , which are composable units of abstraction. We will learn more about constructs soon. This initial code created by cdk8s init defines an app with a single, empty, chart. When you synthesize the app, a Kubernetes manifest YAML will be produced for each Chart in your app and will write it to the dist directory. At this point, the YAML file should be empty since we haven\u2019t defined any resources yet. Let have a look at the code: TypeScript main.ts import { Construct } from 'constructs' ; import { App , Chart , ChartProps } from 'cdk8s' ; export class MyChart extends Chart { constructor ( scope : Construct , id : string , props : ChartProps = { }) { super ( scope , id , props ); // define resources here } } const app = new App (); new MyChart ( app , 'hello' ); app . synth (); To produce and inspect the generated manifest, you can run: npm run compile && cdk8s synth dist/hello.k8s.yaml cat dist/hello.k8s.yaml <EMPTY> Note that since TypeScript is a compiled language, we will need to compile .ts files to .js in order to execute our cdk8s app. To avoid explicitly compiling every time, you can run a watch process in the background by running: npm run watch Python main.py #!/usr/bin/env python from constructs import Construct from cdk8s import App , Chart class MyChart ( Chart ): def __init__ ( self , scope : Construct , id : str ): super () . __init__ ( scope , id ) # define resources here app = App () MyChart ( app , \"hello\" ) app . synth () To produce and inspect the generated manifest, you can run: cdk8s synth dist/hello.k8s.yaml cat dist/hello.k8s.yaml <EMPTY> Java src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/Main.java package com.mycompany.app ; import software.constructs.Construct ; import org.cdk8s.App ; import org.cdk8s.Chart ; import org.cdk8s.ChartProps ; public class Main extends Chart { public Main ( final Construct scope , final String id ) { this ( scope , id , null ); } public Main ( final Construct scope , final String id , final ChartProps options ) { super ( scope , id , options ); // define resources here } public static void main ( String [] args ) { final App app = new App (); new Main ( app , \"hello\" ); app . synth (); } } To produce and inspect the generated manifest, you can run: cdk8s synth dist/hello.k8s.yaml cat dist/hello.k8s.yaml <EMPTY> Go main.go package main import ( \"github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs/v3\" \"github.com/aws/jsii-runtime-go\" \"github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s-core-go/cdk8s\" ) type MyChartProps struct { cdk8s . ChartProps } func NewMyChart ( scope constructs . Construct , id string , props * MyChartProps ) cdk8s . Chart { var cprops cdk8s . ChartProps if props != nil { cprops = props . ChartProps } chart := cdk8s . NewChart ( scope , jsii . String ( id ), & cprops ) // define resources here return chart } func main () { app := cdk8s . NewApp ( nil ) NewMyChart ( app , \"hello\" , nil ) app . Synth () } To produce and inspect the generated manifest, you can run: cdk8s synth dist/hello.k8s.yaml cat dist/hello.k8s.yaml <EMPTY> Importing Constructs for the Kubernetes API \u00b6 OK, now let\u2019s define some Kubernetes API objects inside our chart. Similarly to charts and apps , Kubernetes API Objects are also represented in cdk8s as constructs . These constructs are imported to your project using the cdk8s import command which will add source files to your project that include constructs that represent the Kubernetes API. Info When cdk8s init created your project it already executed cdk8s import for you, so you should see an imports directory already there. You can either commit this directory to source-control or generate it as part of your build process. Now, let\u2019s use these constructs to define a simple Kubernetes application which contains Service and a Deployment resources inspired by paulbouwer \u2018s hello-kubernetes project. TypeScript import { Construct } from 'constructs' ; import { App , Chart , ChartProps } from 'cdk8s' ; // imported constructs import { KubeDeployment , KubeService , IntOrString } from './imports/k8s' ; export class MyChart extends Chart { constructor ( scope : Construct , id : string , props : ChartProps = { }) { super ( scope , id , props ); const label = { app : 'hello-k8s' }; // notice that there is no assigment necessary when creating resources. // simply instantiating the resource is enough because it adds it to the construct tree via // the first argument, which is always the parent construct. // its a little confusing at first glance, but this is an inherent aspect of the constructs // programming model, and you will encounter it many times. // you can still perform an assignment of course, if you need to access // atrtibutes of the resource in other parts of the code. new KubeService ( this , 'service' , { spec : { type : 'LoadBalancer' , ports : [ { port : 80 , targetPort : IntOrString.fromNumber ( 8080 ) } ], selector : label } }); new KubeDeployment ( this , 'deployment' , { spec : { replicas : 2 , selector : { matchLabels : label }, template : { metadata : { labels : label }, spec : { containers : [ { name : 'hello-kubernetes' , image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , ports : [ { containerPort : 8080 } ] } ] } } } }); } } const app = new App (); new MyChart ( app , 'hello' ); app . synth (); Now, to synthesize the app, run: npm run compile && cdk8s synth Python #!/usr/bin/env python from constructs import Construct from cdk8s import App , Chart from imports import k8s class MyChart ( Chart ): def __init__ ( self , scope : Construct , id : str ): super () . __init__ ( scope , id ) # define resources here label = { \"app\" : \"hello-k8s\" } # notice that there is no assigment necessary when creating resources. # simply instantiating the resource is enough because it adds it to the construct tree via # the first argument, which is always the parent construct. # its a little confusing at first glance, but this is an inherent aspect of the constructs # programming model, and you will encounter it many times. # you can still perform an assignment of course, if you need to access # atrtibutes of the resource in other parts of the code. k8s .

They are the instrument that enables composition and creation of higher-level abstractions through normal object-oriented classes. If you come from the Kubernetes world, you can think of constructs as programmatically defined Helm Charts. The nice thing about constructs being \u201cprogrammatically defined\u201d is that we can use them to leverage the full power of object-oriented programming. For example: You can express the abstraction\u2019s API using strong-typed data types You can express rich interactions with methods and properties You can create polymorphic programming models through interfaces and base classes Share them through regular package managers Test them using our familiar testing tools and techniques Version them \u2026and do all that stuff that we\u2019ve been doing with software in the past 20 years. So let\u2019s create our first Kubernetes construct. We\u2019ll call it WebService and it will basically be a generalization of the hello world program. It\u2019s actually quite useful. For example, this one line will add a hello world service to our chart: TypeScript new WebService ( this , 'hello-k8s' , { image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' }); It can also be customized through an API: new WebService ( this , 'hello-k8s' , { image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , containerPort : 8080 , replicas : 10 }); Python WebService ( self , 'hello' , image = 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' ) It can also be customized through an API: WebService ( self , 'hello-k8s' , image = 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , container_port = 8080 , replicas = 10 ) Java new WebService ( this , \"hello-k8s\" , new WebServiceProps . Builder () . image ( \"paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7\" ) . build ()); It can also be customized through an API: new WebService ( this , \"hello-k8s\" , new WebServiceProps . Builder () . image ( \"paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7\" ) . replicas ( 2 ) . build ()); Go NewWebService ( chart , jsii . String ( \"hello\" ), & WebServiceProps { Image : jsii . String ( \"paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7\" ), }) It can also be customized through an API: NewWebService ( chart , jsii . String ( \"hello\" ), & WebServiceProps { Image : jsii . String ( \"paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7\" ), ContainerPort : jsii . Number ( 8080 ), Replicas : jsii . Number ( 10 ), }) Here\u2019s how to implement WebService : TypeScript Create a file lib/web-service.ts (the convention is to use lib for reusable components): import { Construct } from 'constructs' ; import { Names } from 'cdk8s' ; import { KubeDeployment , KubeService , IntOrString } from '../imports/k8s' ; export interface WebServiceProps { /** * The Docker image to use for this service. */ readonly image : string ; /** * Number of replicas. * * @default 1 */ readonly replicas? : number ; /** * External port. * * @default 80 */ readonly port? : number ; /** * Internal port. * * @default 8080 */ readonly containerPort? : number ; } export class WebService extends Construct { constructor ( scope : Construct , id : string , props : WebServiceProps ) { super ( scope , id ); const port = props . port || 80 ; const containerPort = props . containerPort || 8080 ; const label = { app : Names.toDnsLabel ( this ) }; const replicas = props . replicas ?? 1 ; new KubeService ( this , 'service' , { spec : { type : 'LoadBalancer' , ports : [ { port , targetPort : IntOrString.fromNumber ( containerPort ) } ], selector : label } }); new KubeDeployment ( this , 'deployment' , { spec : { replicas , selector : { matchLabels : label }, template : { metadata : { labels : label }, spec : { containers : [ { name : 'app' , image : props.image , ports : [ { containerPort } ] } ] } } } }); } } Now, let\u2019s edit main.ts and use our new construct: import { Construct } from 'constructs' ; import { App , Chart , ChartProps } from 'cdk8s' ; import { WebService } from './lib/web-service' ; export class MyChart extends Chart { constructor ( scope : Construct , id : string , props : ChartProps = { }) { super ( scope , id , props ); new WebService ( this , 'hello' , { image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , replicas : 2 }); new WebService ( this , 'ghost' , { image : 'ghost' , containerPort : 2368 }); } } const app = new App (); new MyChart ( app , 'hello' ); app . synth (); Python Create a file webservice.py with the following content: from constructs import Construct , Node from imports import k8s class WebService ( Construct ): def __init__ ( self , scope : Construct , id : str , * , image : str , replicas : int = 1 , port : int = 80 , container_port : int = 8080 ): super () . __init__ ( scope , id ) label = { 'app' : Node . of ( self ) . unique_id } k8s .

They are the instrument that enables composition and creation of higher-level abstractions through normal object-oriented classes. If you come from the Kubernetes world, you can think of constructs as programmatically defined Helm Charts. The nice thing about constructs being \u201cprogrammatically defined\u201d is that we can use them to leverage the full power of object-oriented programming. For example: You can express the abstraction\u2019s API using strong-typed data types You can express rich interactions with methods and properties You can create polymorphic programming models through interfaces and base classes Share them through regular package managers Test them using our familiar testing tools and techniques Version them \u2026and do all that stuff that we\u2019ve been doing with software in the past 20 years. So let\u2019s create our first Kubernetes construct. We\u2019ll call it WebService and it will basically be a generalization of the hello world program. It\u2019s actually quite useful. For example, this one line will add a hello world service to our chart: TypeScript new WebService ( this , 'hello-k8s' , { image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' }); It can also be customized through an API: new WebService ( this , 'hello-k8s' , { image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , containerPort : 8080 , replicas : 10 }); Python WebService ( self , 'hello' , image = 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' ) It can also be customized through an API: WebService ( self , 'hello-k8s' , image = 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , container_port = 8080 , replicas = 10 ) Java new WebService ( this , \"hello-k8s\" , new WebServiceProps .

String ( \"paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7\" ), ContainerPort : jsii . Number ( 8080 ), Replicas : jsii . Number ( 10 ), }) Here\u2019s how to implement WebService : TypeScript Create a file lib/web-service.ts (the convention is to use lib for reusable components): import { Construct } from 'constructs' ; import { Names } from 'cdk8s' ; import { KubeDeployment , KubeService , IntOrString } from '../imports/k8s' ; export interface WebServiceProps { /** * The Docker image to use for this service. */ readonly image : string ; /** * Number of replicas. * * @default 1 */ readonly replicas? : number ; /** * External port. * * @default 80 */ readonly port? : number ; /** * Internal port. * * @default 8080 */ readonly containerPort? : number ; } export class WebService extends Construct { constructor ( scope : Construct , id : string , props : WebServiceProps ) { super ( scope , id ); const port = props . port || 80 ; const containerPort = props . containerPort || 8080 ; const label = { app : Names.toDnsLabel ( this ) }; const replicas = props . replicas ?? 1 ; new KubeService ( this , 'service' , { spec : { type : 'LoadBalancer' , ports : [ { port , targetPort : IntOrString.fromNumber ( containerPort ) } ], selector : label } }); new KubeDeployment ( this , 'deployment' , { spec : { replicas , selector : { matchLabels : label }, template : { metadata : { labels : label }, spec : { containers : [ { name : 'app' , image : props.image , ports : [ { containerPort } ] } ] } } } }); } } Now, let\u2019s edit main.ts and use our new construct: import { Construct } from 'constructs' ; import { App , Chart , ChartProps } from 'cdk8s' ; import { WebService } from './lib/web-service' ; export class MyChart extends Chart { constructor ( scope : Construct , id : string , props : ChartProps = { }) { super ( scope , id , props ); new WebService ( this , 'hello' , { image : 'paulbouwer/hello-kubernetes:1.7' , replicas : 2 }); new WebService ( this , 'ghost' , { image : 'ghost' , containerPort : 2368 }); } } const app = new App (); new MyChart ( app , 'hello' ); app . synth (); Python Create a file webservice.py with the following content: from constructs import Construct , Node from imports import k8s class WebService ( Construct ): def __init__ ( self , scope : Construct , id : str , * , image : str , replicas : int = 1 , port : int = 80 , container_port : int = 8080 ): super () . __init__ ( scope , id ) label = { 'app' : Node . of ( self ) . unique_id } k8s .

Kubernetes APIs \u00b6 To generate constructs for all Kubernetes API objects of a certain version, use: cdk8s import k8s The import command will generate files under an \u201cimports\u201d directory inside your project with constructs for each API object in the Kubernetes spec. Note It is recommended to commit these generated files into your source control. By default, generated class names will be named KubeXyz where Xyz is the API object kind (e.g. KubeDeployment ). Kubernetes Versions \u00b6 Use the @version notation to import a specific Kubernetes version: cdk8s import k8s@1.16.0 Alternatively, you can specify your k8s import in the cdk8s.yaml config file: imports : - k8s@1.17.0 API Object Versions \u00b6 When importing the core Kubernetes API objects, cdk8s import will generate constructs both for stable APIs (e.g. v1 ) and pre-stable APIs ( v1beta1 ). To ensure compatibility across Kubernetes versions, construct classes generated for non-stable resources will include a postfix with the API level. For example, the import for k8s@1.18 includes KubeIngressV1Beta1 as the only Ingress resource. This is because Ingress has not been stabilized yet. The import for k8s@1.19 will also include an Ingress construct which represents the v1 resource. CRDs \u00b6 You can import CRDs from local files or URLs: cdk8s import my_crd.yaml Or from cdk8s.yaml : imports : - my_crd.yaml A CRD with group mygroup.io and kind Foo will be imported to the following locations: TypeScript: imports/mygroup.io.ts Python: imports/mygroup/io Importing CRDs from a cluster \u00b6 If the imported YAML is a List of CRDs, all these CRDs will be imported.

Similarly, in CDKs, escape hatches are mechanisms that allow users to tweak the synthesized output when the abstraction they use does not \u201chold water\u201d. You may need to use an escape hatch in the following cases: You are using an imported API object (e.g. KubeDeployment ) and there is an issue with the schema or a bug in \u201cimport\u201d which results in an invalid manifest or missing fields (as an example see issue #140 ). You are using a high-level API (e.g. cdk8s+) which does not expose some functionality which exists in the lower-level resources. Patching API objects directly \u00b6 The ApiObject class, which is the base of all objects synthesized into a Kubernetes manifest offers an API for patching the synthesized output at the wire level using JSON Patch ( RFC-6902 ): import { JsonPatch } from 'cdk8s' ; apiObject . addJsonPatch ( JsonPatch . replace ( '/foo' , 'bar' )); apiObject . addJsonPatch ( JsonPatch . add ( '/foo/bar/0' , { bar : 123 })); During synthesis, patches are applied in-order after the API object synthesized itself. All classes generated using the CLI import command extend ApiObject , and therefore include the addJsonPatch() method. Patching API objects behind higher-level APIs \u00b6 The second use case for using escape hatches is when you are working against a higher-level construct which, for some reason, does not allow you to achieve what you need. For example, let\u2019s say you are using the Pod class from cdk8s+ and you wish to set [ enableServiceLinks ] to true . This feature is currently not supported in the cdk8s+ Pod API, so you\u2019ll want to patch the underlying KubePod and set this value. To do that, you will need to \u201cpeak\u201d into the construct tree and find the underlying API object, so you can apply the patch to it: import { Pod } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' ; import { ApiObject } from 'cdk8s' ; const pod = new Pod (...); const kubePod = ApiObject . of ( pod ); kubePod . addJsonPatch (...); The ApiObject.of() method uses capabilities of the constructs programming model to find the \u201cdefault child\u201d of a construct ( Node.of(c).defaultChild ). When a construct is initialized, it can either explicitly assign the value of Node.of(this).defaultChild = xxx or it can use the identity Default for one of its child constructs. This will automatically identify it as the default child. Tip The ApiObject.of() method recursively searches down the construct tree through child constructs called Default until it finds a child of type ApiObject . This means, for example, that ApiObject.of(apiObject) returns the same object. There could be situations where a default child is not recorded by a high-level construct. This still does not mean you are blocked from patching the underlying API objects. You can still use Node.of(x) to traverse the construct tree to obtain the child.

When a construct is initialized, it can either explicitly assign the value of Node.of(this).defaultChild = xxx or it can use the identity Default for one of its child constructs. This will automatically identify it as the default child. Tip The ApiObject.of() method recursively searches down the construct tree through child constructs called Default until it finds a child of type ApiObject . This means, for example, that ApiObject.of(apiObject) returns the same object. There could be situations where a default child is not recorded by a high-level construct. This still does not mean you are blocked from patching the underlying API objects. You can still use Node.of(x) to traverse the construct tree to obtain the child. For example, you can use Node.of(x).findChild(id) to retrieve any child by its ID.","title":"Patching API objects behind higher-level APIs"},{"location":"concepts/helm/","text":"Helm Support \u00b6 You can use the Helm construct in order to include Helm charts.

Built on top of the auto-generated building blocks provided by cdk8s, this library includes a hand crafted construct for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API\u2019s with reduced complexity. Here is an example of how we would deploy a simple nginx container, once with the low-level API (on the left), and once with the high level abstraction (on the right). cdk8s+ is vended as a separate library for each kubernetes spec version. The documentation presented here represents version 1.22.0 and is vended as the cdk8s-plus-22 library. Naming conventions \u00b6 Stable resources are represented by a construct of the same kind . For example, the io.k8s.api.core.v1.Pod resource maps to the Pod construct . Non stable resources are suffixed with their api version . For example, the io.k8s.api.networking.v1beta1.Ingress maps to the IngressV1Beta1 construct . Spec compatibility \u00b6 Per kubernetes compatibility guarantees , stable resources in this library are compatible with any spec version higher or equal to 1.22.0 . Non-stable resources are not guaranteed to be compatible, as they may be removed in future spec versions. Notice If you are deploying manifests produced by cdk8s-plus-22 onto clusters of a lower version, you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid manifests. FAQ \u00b6 What\u2019s the difference between cdk8s-plus-20 , cdk8s-plus-21 , and cdk8s-plus-22 ? \u00b6 These are separately vended libraries that each target a different kubernetes version, marked by the -XX suffix. For example, cdk8s-plus-22 targets kubernetes version 1.22.0 . We offer a dedicated package per Kubernetes version to allow users to match their manifests to the Kubernetes version they are operating. This way, users are only exposed to a set of capabilities offered by their specific cluster, preventing deployment errors caused by version mismatches. I operate Kubernetes version 1.XX - which cdk8s+ library should I be using? \u00b6 If there is a cdk8s-plus-XX library that matches your target Kubernetes version, we recommend using it since all Kubernetes manifests generated using it will be compatible. If there is not a matching cdk8s-plus-XX library, we recommend using the closest matching version. The manifests generated by cdk8s-plus-XX may also work for older versions of Kubernetes, but you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid manifests. I\u2019m using cdk8s-plus-XX - which kubernetes versions will my manifest work on? \u00b6 If you are using stable APIs (those that are not in alpha or beta), manifests generated in cdk8s-plus-XX will work in Kubernetes versions 1.XX.0 and above. Unstable APIs (which are always labeled in cdk8s+ using a suffix, e.g. IngressV1Beta1 ) may work in newer versions of Kubernetes, but it is also possible they have been removed. The manifests generated by cdk8s-plus-XX may also work for older versions of Kubernetes, but you might encounter some unsupported spec properties or invalid manifests.

Contributions of all shapes and sizes are welcome and celebrated: Reporting Issues Code Contributions RFCs We follows the CNCF Community Code of Conduct Reporting Issues \u00b6 If any part of the project has bugs or documentation mistakes, please let us know by raising an issue. We treat bugs and mistakes very seriously and believe no issue is too small. Before creating a bug report, please check that an issue reporting the same problem does not already exist. In addition, make sure you are submitting the issue to the correct repository. If you know your issue petains to a specific cdk8s package, it better belongs in the respective repository. For a list of the repositories, see Repositories An issue can either be a bug report or a feature-request . If you wish to ask a question or seek guidance, please consider one of the other support channels . Bug reports \u00b6 To make the bug report accurate and easy to understand, please try to create bug reports that are: Specific : Include as much details as possible: which version, what environment, what configuration, etc. Reproducible : Include the steps to reproduce the problem. We understand some issues might be hard to reproduce, please includes the steps that might lead to the problem. If possible, please provide a minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug. Isolated : Please try to isolate and reproduce the bug with minimum dependencies. It would significantly slow down the speed to fix a bug if too many dependencies are involved in a bug report. Unique : Do not duplicate existing bug report. Scoped : One bug per report. Do not follow up with another bug inside one report. We might ask for further information to locate a bug. A duplicated bug report will be closed. Submit a bug report here . Feature Requests \u00b6 We also accept suggestions for new features or missing capabilities as GitHub issues. The most important aspect of a suggestion issue is to provide as many details as possible about your use case and less focus on the solution. It is usually possible to support different use cases in many different ways, and we need to understand the motivation before we dive into a solution. If you wish to suggest a major change to the project, please consider to submit an RFC instead of a simple issue. An RFC also starts with a GitHub issue. Submit a suggestion here Code Contributions \u00b6 The general workflow for code contributions: Submit/find an issue in this repository Clone the relevant repo Make your code change Write tests & update docs Build & test locally Submit a pull request (Iterate) Your PR will be approved and merged Tracking issue \u00b6 All pull requests should be tracked with a GitHub issue. You should search for an existing issue or raise a new bug or suggestion . Add a comment indicating you are willing to pick it up in order to ensure no one else is currently working on it. If this is a major contribution, consider submitting an RFC to obtain feedback from the community and maintainers. Repositories \u00b6 This project consists of multiple modules, maintained and released via the following repositories: cdk8s-cli : command-line interface cdk8s-core : core library cdk8s-plus : high-level constructs for Kubernetes core. Development environment \u00b6 Prerequisites: Node.js >= 12.14.0 yarn >= 1.22.0 Prepare your environment: Fork the relevant repo and obtain a local clone. Install all dependencies: yarn install Run yarn build to build all modules. Unit tests \u00b6 Unit tests are located under the test/ directory within each module and use the jest framework. To run unit tests, execute yarn test either from the root of the repo (to unit test all modules) or from individual module directories: yarn test Out tests utilize jest snapshot testing . In case a snapshot needs to be updated, just run: yarn test -u Integration Tests \u00b6 Integration tests are executed against the latest published modules . This means that in order to execute integration tests against a development version, you\u2019lol need to yarn link your local version to this repository (all deps are at the root): $ cd cdk8s-core $ yarn link $ cd ../cdk8s $ yarn link cdk8s Now, you can run integration tests via: yarn integ Our integration tests also utilize snapshot testing. To update integration test snapshots, run: yarn integ:update Running Integration Tests \u00b6 The test directory contains integration tests for the cdk8s project. Each subdirectory represents a single test, with an entrypoint of test.sh . Tests are written as simple shell scripts and can simulate user activity. You can either run individual tests by executing their entrypoint directly (e.g. test-python-app/test.sh ) or run all tests by executing the script ./test-all.sh . Writing Integration Tests \u00b6 Create a new subdirectory with a test- prefix. Create a file named test.sh , make it executable. Test Environment: The script test.sh is executed within a temporary working directory under /tmp/xxxx/test (where xxxx is some random tmp file). See existing tests as examples on how to bring in auxiliary files to the test. Test MUST NOT install any dependencies or the cdk8s CLI. They can expect it to be available in the environment. To install dependencies from package managers, use yarn , npm , pipenv , mvn and nuget . Those programs will be shimmed to allow consuming local dependencies. Snapshot Testing \u00b6 Some integration tests utilize a simple snapshot testing mechanism. To update snapshots, run tests with: UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 Or, run this from the root of the repo: yarn integ:update Docker environment for integration tests \u00b6 Due to the polyglot nature of the jsii tools used by cdk8s, the toolchain requirements are somewhat more complicated than for most projects. To help with this, you can use the jsii/superchain docker image that includes all the required tools. In order to get an interactive shell within a superchain container you can use the following command. docker run --rm --net=host -it -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD jsii/superchain Then once in the docker shell, you can package and execute the tests as normal. $ pip install pipenv # Currently not included in jsii docker image $ yarn build $ yarn run package $ yarn integ:update Note: this may leave some files owned as the docker root user id. These will need to be cleaned up manually. Pull Requests \u00b6 We use the PR title when we automatically generate the change log for each release. Therefore please following these guidelines to the letter: PR title : Must adhere to conventional commits . All lowercase with no period at the end of the title If this is a fix (bug) the title should describe the bug If this is a feat (feature) the title should describe the feature PR description : Describe how did you fix the bug or what changes you had to make in order to implement the feature Indicate fixes #NNN or resolves #NNN with the tracking issue number. If you had to test your change manually, describe how you tested it and paste the test results. If this is a breaking change, the last paragraph should describe the breaking change with the prefix BREAKING CHANGE: xxxxxx . Developer Certificate Of Origin (DCO) \u00b6 Every commit should be signed-off in compliance with the Developer Certificate Of Origin . You can sign your commits by using the git commit -s command. To configure automatic signoff, see git-hooks . Documentation \u00b6 Documentation is rendered from markdown using mkdocs-material and sourced from the docs directory. API documentation for cdk8s and all cdk8s-plus-* packages is auto-generated from inline docstrings during build. To test locally, install python3 deps: pip3 install -r docs/requirements.txt And then: mkdocs serve This will serve a local web server with the website. A good reference for syntax and capabilities is the mkdocs-material website. Examples \u00b6 Examples are stored under examples and organized according to programming language. Every example also has an entry under docs/examples/xxx which describes the example and includes links to the source code (on the main branch). RFCs \u00b6 An RFC (request for comments) is a document that proposes and details a change or addition to cdk8s. It also is a process for reviewing and discussing the proposal and tracking its implementation. \u201cRequest for comments\u201d means a request for discussion and oversight about the future of cdk8s from contributors and users. It is an open forum for suggestions, questions, and feedback. To create an RFC follow this process: Create an [issue][https://github.com/cdk8s-team/cdk8s/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=rfc.md&title=%5BRFC%5D+describe+your+RFC] which will be the tracking issue for this RFC. Title should represent the title of the RFC. Description should provide the motivation for the RFC. Create a markdown file based off of rfc/0000-template.md under the rfc/<nnnn>-<title-of-rfc> where <nnnn> is the tracking issue number and <title-of-rfc> is a symbolic name for the title. For example: rfc/0030-construct-operators.md . File a pull request with this markdown file. The title of the PR should indicate rfc: <nnnn> <same as issue title> . The RFC will be reviewed as a pull request and once merged it means it is ready for implementation.

String > getFinalizers (); Type: java.util.List< java.lang.String > Default: No finalizers. Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/ labels Optional \u00b6 public java . util .

String getName (); Type: java.lang.String Default: an app-unique name generated by the chart The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster. Normally, you shouldn\u2019t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness. You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the chart.generateObjectName method. If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won\u2019t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified. namespace Optional \u00b6 public java . lang . String getNamespace (); Type: java.lang.String Default: undefined (will be assigned to the \u2018default\u2019 namespace) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \u201cdefault\u201d namespace, but \u201cdefault\u201d is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces ownerReferences Optional \u00b6 public java . util . List < OwnerReference > getOwnerReferences (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.OwnerReference > Default: automatically set by Kubernetes List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don\u2019t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/ ApiObjectProps \u00b6 Options for defining API objects.

Boolean getBlockOwnerDeletion (); Type: java.lang.Boolean Default: false. To set this field, a user needs \u201cdelete\u201d permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned. If true, AND if the owner has the \u201cforegroundDeletion\u201d finalizer, then the owner cannot be deleted from the key-value store until this reference is removed. Defaults to false. To set this field, a user needs \u201cdelete\u201d permission of the owner, otherwise 422 (Unprocessable Entity) will be returned. controller Optional \u00b6 public java . lang . Boolean getController (); Type: java.lang.Boolean If true, this reference points to the managing controller. SizeConversionOptions \u00b6 Options for how to convert time to a different unit.

Classes \u00b6 ApiObjectMetadataDefinition \u00b6 Object metadata. Initializers \u00b6 import org.cdk8s.ApiObjectMetadataDefinition ; ApiObjectMetadataDefinition . Builder . create () // .annotations(java.util.Map<java.lang.String, java.lang.String>) // .finalizers(java.util.List<java.lang.String>) // .labels(java.util.Map<java.lang.String, java.lang.String>) // .name(java.lang.String) // .namespace(java.lang.String) // .ownerReferences(java.util.List<OwnerReference>) . build (); annotations Optional \u00b6 Type: java.util.Map java.lang.String > Default: No annotations. Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations finalizers Optional \u00b6 Type: java.util.List< java.lang.String > Default: No finalizers. Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/ labels Optional \u00b6 Type: java.util.Map java.lang.String > Default: No labels. Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels name Optional \u00b6 Type: java.lang.String Default: an app-unique name generated by the chart The unique, namespace-global, name of this object inside the Kubernetes cluster. Normally, you shouldn\u2019t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness. You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the chart.generateObjectName method. If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won\u2019t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified. namespace Optional \u00b6 Type: java.lang.String Default: undefined (will be assigned to the \u2018default\u2019 namespace) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \u201cdefault\u201d namespace, but \u201cdefault\u201d is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces ownerReferences Optional \u00b6 Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.OwnerReference > Default: automatically set by Kubernetes List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don\u2019t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/ Methods \u00b6 add \u00b6 public add ( java . lang .

This graph includes the dependency relationships between all nodes in the node (construct) sub-tree who\u2019s root is this Node. Note that this means that lonely nodes (no dependencies and no dependants) are also included in this graph as childless children of the root node of the graph.

List [ str ] Type: typing.List[ str ] Default: No finalizers. Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.

The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness. You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the chart.generateObjectName method. If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won\u2019t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified. namespace Optional \u00b6 namespace : str Type: str Default: undefined (will be assigned to the \u2018default\u2019 namespace) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \u201cdefault\u201d namespace, but \u201cdefault\u201d is the canonical representation.

If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field.

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations finalizers Optional \u00b6 public readonly finalizers : string []; Type: string [] Default: No finalizers. Namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/ labels Optional \u00b6 public readonly labels : {[ key : string ] : string }; Type: {[ key: string ]: string } Default: No labels.

Normally, you shouldn\u2019t specify names for objects and let the CDK generate a name for you that is application-unique. The names CDK generates are composed from the construct path components, separated by dots and a suffix that is based on a hash of the entire path, to ensure uniqueness. You can supply custom name allocation logic by overriding the chart.generateObjectName method. If you use an explicit name here, bear in mind that this reduces the composability of your construct because it won\u2019t be possible to include more than one instance in any app. Therefore it is highly recommended to leave this unspecified. namespace Optional \u00b6 public readonly namespace : string ; Type: string Default: undefined (will be assigned to the \u2018default\u2019 namespace) Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \u201cdefault\u201d namespace, but \u201cdefault\u201d is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces ownerReferences Optional \u00b6 public readonly ownerReferences : OwnerReference []; Type: cdk8s.OwnerReference [] Default: automatically set by Kubernetes List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller. Kubernetes sets the value of this field automatically for objects that are dependents of other objects like ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, Deployments, Jobs and CronJobs, and ReplicationControllers. You can also configure these relationships manually by changing the value of this field. However, you usually don\u2019t need to and can allow Kubernetes to automatically manage the relationships. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/ ApiObjectProps \u00b6 Options for defining API objects.

Deployment \u00b6 Implements: org.cdk8s.plus17.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: org.cdk8s.plus17.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage.

Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public java . lang .

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import org.cdk8s.plus17.Volume ; new Volume ( java . lang . String name , java . lang .

DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Java"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/java/#cdk8s-plus-17-java","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-17 (Java) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/java/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/java/#configmap","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus17.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/java/#deployment","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus17.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_17.IngressV1Beta1Tls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI.

Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. add_tls \u00b6 def add_tls ( tls : typing .

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_17 cdk8s_plus_17 .

StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_17.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_17 cdk8s_plus_17 .

List [ IngressV1Beta1Tls ] = None ) metadata Optional \u00b6 metadata : ApiObjectMetadata Type: cdk8s.ApiObjectMetadata Metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. default_backend Optional \u00b6 default_backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend Type: cdk8s_plus_17.IngressV1Beta1Backend The default backend services requests that do not match any rule. Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 rules : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Rule ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_17.IngressV1Beta1Rule ] Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 tls : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Tls ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_17.IngressV1Beta1Tls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressV1Beta1Rule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_17 cdk8s_plus_17 . IngressV1Beta1Rule ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend , host : str = None , path : str = None ) backend Required \u00b6 backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend Type: cdk8s_plus_17.IngressV1Beta1Backend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 host : str Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 path : str Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. IngressV1Beta1Tls \u00b6 Represents the TLS configuration mapping that is passed to the ingress controller for SSL termination. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_17 cdk8s_plus_17 . IngressV1Beta1Tls ( hosts : typing . List [ str ] = None , secret : ISecret = None ) hosts Optional \u00b6 hosts : typing . List [ str ] Type: typing.List[ str ] Default: If unspecified, it defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress. Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 secret : ISecret Type: cdk8s_plus_17.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

The TCP port to use when sending the GET request. Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_17 cdk8s_plus_17 . Volume ( name : str , config : typing .

However, you can set the emptyDir.medium field to EmptyDirMedium.MEMORY to tell Kubernetes to mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. size_limit Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s.Size Default: limit is undefined Total amount of local storage required for this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium.

Enums \u00b6 EmptyDirMedium \u00b6 The medium on which to store the volume. DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Python"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/python/#cdk8s-plus-17-python","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-17 (Python) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/python/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/python/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s_plus_17.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/python/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s_plus_17.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import { ServiceAccount } from 'cdk8s-plus-17' new ServiceAccount ( scope : Construct , id : string , props? : ServiceAccountProps ) scope Required \u00b6 Type: constructs.Construct id Required \u00b6 Type: string props Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-17.ServiceAccountProps Methods \u00b6 addSecret \u00b6 public addSecret ( secret : ISecret ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-17.ISecret The secret.

Returns a copy. To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-17.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates.

IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public readonly path : string ; Type: string Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-17' new Volume ( name : string , config : any ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string config Required \u00b6 Type: any Static Functions \u00b6 fromConfigMap \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-17' Volume . fromConfigMap ( configMap : IConfigMap , options? : ConfigMapVolumeOptions ) configMap Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-17.IConfigMap The config map to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-17.ConfigMapVolumeOptions Options. fromEmptyDir \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-17' Volume . fromEmptyDir ( name : string , options? : EmptyDirVolumeOptions ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-17.EmptyDirVolumeOptions Additional options.

Enums \u00b6 EmptyDirMedium \u00b6 The medium on which to store the volume. DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"TypeScript"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-17-typescript","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-17 (TypeScript) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/typescript/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/typescript/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-17.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-17/typescript/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-17.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: org.cdk8s.plus20.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage.

Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 public java . util . List < IngressV1Beta1Rule > getRules (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.plus20.IngressV1Beta1Rule > Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 public java . util . List < IngressV1Beta1Tls > getTls (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.plus20.IngressV1Beta1Tls > TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressV1Beta1Rule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path.

String getHost (); Type: java.lang.String Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public java . lang . String getPath (); Type: java.lang.String Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019.

Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 public ISecret getSecret (); Type: org.cdk8s.plus20.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import org.cdk8s.plus20.Volume ; new Volume ( java . lang . String name , java . lang .

NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Java"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/java/#cdk8s-plus-20-java","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-20 (Java) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/java/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/java/#configmap","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus20.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/java/#deployment","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus20.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Tls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. Methods \u00b6 add_default_backend \u00b6 def add_default_backend ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to use for requests that do not match any rule. add_host_default_backend \u00b6 def add_host_default_backend ( host : str , backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) host Required \u00b6 Type: str The host name to match. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to route to. add_host_rule \u00b6 def add_host_rule ( host : str , path : str , backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) host Required \u00b6 Type: str The host name. path Required \u00b6 Type: str The HTTP path. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to route requests to. add_rule \u00b6 def add_rule ( path : str , backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) path Required \u00b6 Type: str The HTTP path. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to route requests to. add_rules \u00b6 def add_rules ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend , host : str = None , path : str = None ) backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. add_tls \u00b6 def add_tls ( tls : typing .

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_20 cdk8s_plus_20 .

ServiceAccount \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_20.IServiceAccount A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_20 cdk8s_plus_20 .

StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_20.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_20 cdk8s_plus_20 .

List [ IngressV1Beta1Rule ] = None , tls : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Tls ] = None ) metadata Optional \u00b6 metadata : ApiObjectMetadata Type: cdk8s.ApiObjectMetadata Metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. default_backend Optional \u00b6 default_backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend The default backend services requests that do not match any rule. Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 rules : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Rule ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Rule ] Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 tls : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Tls ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Tls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressV1Beta1Rule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_20 cdk8s_plus_20 . IngressV1Beta1Rule ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend , host : str = None , path : str = None ) backend Required \u00b6 backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend Type: cdk8s_plus_20.IngressV1Beta1Backend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 host : str Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 path : str Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. IngressV1Beta1Tls \u00b6 Represents the TLS configuration mapping that is passed to the ingress controller for SSL termination. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_20 cdk8s_plus_20 . IngressV1Beta1Tls ( hosts : typing . List [ str ] = None , secret : ISecret = None ) hosts Optional \u00b6 hosts : typing . List [ str ] Type: typing.List[ str ] Default: If unspecified, it defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress. Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 secret : ISecret Type: cdk8s_plus_20.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

The TCP port to use when sending the GET request. Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_20 cdk8s_plus_20 . Volume ( name : str , config : typing .

EnvFieldPaths \u00b6 POD_NAME \u00b6 The name of the pod. POD_NAMESPACE \u00b6 The namespace of the pod. POD_UID \u00b6 The uid of the pod. POD_LABEL \u00b6 The labels of the pod. POD_ANNOTATION \u00b6 The annotations of the pod. POD_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the pod. SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \u00b6 The service account name of the pod. NODE_NAME \u00b6 The name of the node. NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Python"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/python/#cdk8s-plus-20-python","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-20 (Python) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/python/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/python/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s_plus_20.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/python/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s_plus_20.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck. Clean up older ReplicaSets that you don\u2019t need anymore.

Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

ServiceAccount \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-20.IServiceAccount A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import { ServiceAccount } from 'cdk8s-plus-20' new ServiceAccount ( scope : Construct , id : string , props? : ServiceAccountProps ) scope Required \u00b6 Type: constructs.Construct id Required \u00b6 Type: string props Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.ServiceAccountProps Methods \u00b6 addSecret \u00b6 public addSecret ( secret : ISecret ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.ISecret The secret.

Returns a copy. To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-20.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates.

IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public readonly path : string ; Type: string Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-20' new Volume ( name : string , config : any ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string config Required \u00b6 Type: any Static Functions \u00b6 fromConfigMap \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-20' Volume . fromConfigMap ( configMap : IConfigMap , options? : ConfigMapVolumeOptions ) configMap Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.IConfigMap The config map to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.ConfigMapVolumeOptions Options. fromEmptyDir \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-20' Volume . fromEmptyDir ( name : string , options? : EmptyDirVolumeOptions ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.EmptyDirVolumeOptions Additional options. fromSecret \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-20' Volume . fromSecret ( secret : ISecret , options? : SecretVolumeOptions ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.ISecret The secret to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-20.SecretVolumeOptions Options.

Enums \u00b6 EmptyDirMedium \u00b6 The medium on which to store the volume. DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. EnvFieldPaths \u00b6 POD_NAME \u00b6 The name of the pod. POD_NAMESPACE \u00b6 The namespace of the pod. POD_UID \u00b6 The uid of the pod. POD_LABEL \u00b6 The labels of the pod.

NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"TypeScript"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-20-typescript","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-20 (TypeScript) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/typescript/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/typescript/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-20.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-20/typescript/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-20.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: org.cdk8s.plus21.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage.

Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 public java . util . List < IngressV1Beta1Rule > getRules (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.plus21.IngressV1Beta1Rule > Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 public java . util . List < IngressV1Beta1Tls > getTls (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.plus21.IngressV1Beta1Tls > TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressV1Beta1Rule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path.

String getHost (); Type: java.lang.String Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public java . lang . String getPath (); Type: java.lang.String Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019.

Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 public ISecret getSecret (); Type: org.cdk8s.plus21.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import org.cdk8s.plus21.Volume ; new Volume ( java . lang . String name , java . lang .

NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Java"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/java/#cdk8s-plus-21-java","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-21 (Java) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/java/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/java/#configmap","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus21.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/java/#deployment","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus21.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Tls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. Methods \u00b6 add_default_backend \u00b6 def add_default_backend ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to use for requests that do not match any rule. add_host_default_backend \u00b6 def add_host_default_backend ( host : str , backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) host Required \u00b6 Type: str The host name to match. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to route to. add_host_rule \u00b6 def add_host_rule ( host : str , path : str , backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) host Required \u00b6 Type: str The host name. path Required \u00b6 Type: str The HTTP path. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to route requests to. add_rule \u00b6 def add_rule ( path : str , backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend ) path Required \u00b6 Type: str The HTTP path. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend The backend to route requests to. add_rules \u00b6 def add_rules ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend , host : str = None , path : str = None ) backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. add_tls \u00b6 def add_tls ( tls : typing .

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_21 cdk8s_plus_21 .

ServiceAccount \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_21.IServiceAccount A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_21 cdk8s_plus_21 .

StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_21.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_21 cdk8s_plus_21 .

List [ IngressV1Beta1Rule ] = None , tls : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Tls ] = None ) metadata Optional \u00b6 metadata : ApiObjectMetadata Type: cdk8s.ApiObjectMetadata Metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. default_backend Optional \u00b6 default_backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend The default backend services requests that do not match any rule. Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 rules : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Rule ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Rule ] Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 tls : typing . List [ IngressV1Beta1Tls ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Tls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressV1Beta1Rule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_21 cdk8s_plus_21 . IngressV1Beta1Rule ( backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend , host : str = None , path : str = None ) backend Required \u00b6 backend : IngressV1Beta1Backend Type: cdk8s_plus_21.IngressV1Beta1Backend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 host : str Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 path : str Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. IngressV1Beta1Tls \u00b6 Represents the TLS configuration mapping that is passed to the ingress controller for SSL termination. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_21 cdk8s_plus_21 . IngressV1Beta1Tls ( hosts : typing . List [ str ] = None , secret : ISecret = None ) hosts Optional \u00b6 hosts : typing . List [ str ] Type: typing.List[ str ] Default: If unspecified, it defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress. Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 secret : ISecret Type: cdk8s_plus_21.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

The TCP port to use when sending the GET request. Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_21 cdk8s_plus_21 . Volume ( name : str , config : typing .

EnvFieldPaths \u00b6 POD_NAME \u00b6 The name of the pod. POD_NAMESPACE \u00b6 The namespace of the pod. POD_UID \u00b6 The uid of the pod. POD_LABEL \u00b6 The labels of the pod. POD_ANNOTATION \u00b6 The annotations of the pod. POD_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the pod. SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \u00b6 The service account name of the pod. NODE_NAME \u00b6 The name of the node. NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Python"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/python/#cdk8s-plus-21-python","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-21 (Python) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/python/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/python/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s_plus_21.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/python/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s_plus_21.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck. Clean up older ReplicaSets that you don\u2019t need anymore.

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

ServiceAccount \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-21.IServiceAccount A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import { ServiceAccount } from 'cdk8s-plus-21' new ServiceAccount ( scope : Construct , id : string , props? : ServiceAccountProps ) scope Required \u00b6 Type: constructs.Construct id Required \u00b6 Type: string props Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.ServiceAccountProps Methods \u00b6 addSecret \u00b6 public addSecret ( secret : ISecret ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.ISecret The secret.

Returns a copy. To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-21.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates.

IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public readonly path : string ; Type: string Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-21' new Volume ( name : string , config : any ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string config Required \u00b6 Type: any Static Functions \u00b6 fromConfigMap \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-21' Volume . fromConfigMap ( configMap : IConfigMap , options? : ConfigMapVolumeOptions ) configMap Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.IConfigMap The config map to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.ConfigMapVolumeOptions Options. fromEmptyDir \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-21' Volume . fromEmptyDir ( name : string , options? : EmptyDirVolumeOptions ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.EmptyDirVolumeOptions Additional options. fromSecret \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-21' Volume . fromSecret ( secret : ISecret , options? : SecretVolumeOptions ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.ISecret The secret to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-21.SecretVolumeOptions Options.

Enums \u00b6 EmptyDirMedium \u00b6 The medium on which to store the volume. DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. EnvFieldPaths \u00b6 POD_NAME \u00b6 The name of the pod. POD_NAMESPACE \u00b6 The namespace of the pod. POD_UID \u00b6 The uid of the pod. POD_LABEL \u00b6 The labels of the pod.

NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"TypeScript"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-21-typescript","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-21 (TypeScript) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/typescript/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/typescript/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-21.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-21/typescript/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-21.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion.

With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: org.cdk8s.plus22.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates. Initializers \u00b6 import org.cdk8s.plus22.StatefulSet ; StatefulSet .

List < IngressRule > getRules (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.plus22.IngressRule > Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 public java . util . List < IngressTls > getTls (); Type: java.util.List< org.cdk8s.plus22.IngressTls > TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressRule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path.

String getHost (); Type: java.lang.String Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public java . lang . String getPath (); Type: java.lang.String Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. pathType Optional \u00b6 public HttpIngressPathType getPathType (); Type: org.cdk8s.plus22.HttpIngressPathType Specify how the path is matched against request paths.

Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 public ISecret getSecret (); Type: org.cdk8s.plus22.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import org.cdk8s.plus22.Volume ; new Volume ( java . lang . String name , java . lang .

DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit.

HttpIngressPathType \u00b6 Specify how the path is matched against request paths. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types PREFIX \u00b6 Matches the URL path exactly. EXACT \u00b6 Matches based on a URL path prefix split by \u2018/\u2019. IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC \u00b6 Matching is specified by the underlying IngressClass. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"Java"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/java/#cdk8s-plus-22-java","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-22 (Java) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/java/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/java/#configmap","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus22.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/java/#deployment","text":"Implements: org.cdk8s.plus22.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below. Use Case \u00b6 The following are typical use cases for Deployments: Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background. Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not. Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment. A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate. Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment. Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable. Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment. Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load. Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout. Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.

Ingress \u00b6 Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the endpoints defined by a backend. An Ingress can be configured to give services externally-reachable urls, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name based virtual hosting etc. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 . Ingress ( scope : Construct , id : str , metadata : ApiObjectMetadata = None , default_backend : IngressBackend = None , rules : typing . List [ IngressRule ] = None , tls : typing . List [ IngressTls ] = None ) scope Required \u00b6 Type: constructs.Construct id Required \u00b6 Type: str metadata Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s.ApiObjectMetadata Metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. default_backend Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend The default backend services requests that do not match any rule. Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_22.IngressRule ] Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_22.IngressTls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. Methods \u00b6 add_default_backend \u00b6 def add_default_backend ( backend : IngressBackend ) backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend The backend to use for requests that do not match any rule. add_host_default_backend \u00b6 def add_host_default_backend ( host : str , backend : IngressBackend ) host Required \u00b6 Type: str The host name to match. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend The backend to route to. add_host_rule \u00b6 def add_host_rule ( host : str , path : str , backend : IngressBackend , path_type : HttpIngressPathType = None ) host Required \u00b6 Type: str The host name. path Required \u00b6 Type: str The HTTP path. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend The backend to route requests to. path_type Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.HttpIngressPathType How the path is matched against request paths. add_rule \u00b6 def add_rule ( path : str , backend : IngressBackend , path_type : HttpIngressPathType = None ) path Required \u00b6 Type: str The HTTP path. backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend The backend to route requests to. path_type Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.HttpIngressPathType How the path is matched against request paths. add_rules \u00b6 def add_rules ( backend : IngressBackend , host : str = None , path : str = None , path_type : HttpIngressPathType = None ) backend Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. path_type Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s_plus_22.HttpIngressPathType Specify how the path is matched against request paths. By default, path types will be matched by prefix. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types add_tls \u00b6 def add_tls ( tls : typing . List [ IngressTls ] ) tls Required \u00b6 Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_22.IngressTls ] Job \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_22.IPodTemplate A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot). You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 .

When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 .

StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s_plus_22.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates. Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 .

List [ IngressRule ] = None , tls : typing . List [ IngressTls ] = None ) metadata Optional \u00b6 metadata : ApiObjectMetadata Type: cdk8s.ApiObjectMetadata Metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create. default_backend Optional \u00b6 default_backend : IngressBackend Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend The default backend services requests that do not match any rule. Using this option or the addDefaultBackend() method is equivalent to adding a rule with both path and host undefined. rules Optional \u00b6 rules : typing . List [ IngressRule ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_22.IngressRule ] Routing rules for this ingress. Each rule must define an IngressBackend that will receive the requests that match this rule. If both host and path are not specifiec, this backend will be used as the default backend of the ingress. You can also add rules later using addRule() , addHostRule() , addDefaultBackend() and addHostDefaultBackend() . tls Optional \u00b6 tls : typing . List [ IngressTls ] Type: typing.List[ cdk8s_plus_22.IngressTls ] TLS settings for this ingress. Using this option tells the ingress controller to expose a TLS endpoint. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI. IngressRule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 . IngressRule ( backend : IngressBackend , host : str = None , path : str = None , path_type : HttpIngressPathType = None ) backend Required \u00b6 backend : IngressBackend Type: cdk8s_plus_22.IngressBackend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 host : str Type: str Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 path : str Type: str Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. path_type Optional \u00b6 path_type : HttpIngressPathType Type: cdk8s_plus_22.HttpIngressPathType Specify how the path is matched against request paths. By default, path types will be matched by prefix. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types IngressTls \u00b6 Represents the TLS configuration mapping that is passed to the ingress controller for SSL termination. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 . IngressTls ( hosts : typing . List [ str ] = None , secret : ISecret = None ) hosts Optional \u00b6 hosts : typing . List [ str ] Type: typing.List[ str ] Default: If unspecified, it defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress. Hosts are a list of hosts included in the TLS certificate. The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 secret : ISecret Type: cdk8s_plus_22.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

Limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set, after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible to be deleted immediately after it finishes. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the TTLAfterFinished feature. MountOptions \u00b6 Options for mounts. Initializer \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 .

The TCP port to connect to on the container. Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 . Volume ( name : str , config : typing .

However, you can set the emptyDir.medium field to EmptyDirMedium.MEMORY to tell Kubernetes to mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. size_limit Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s.Size Default: limit is undefined Total amount of local storage required for this EmptyDir volume. The size limit is also applicable for memory medium. The maximum usage on memory medium EmptyDir would be the minimum value between the SizeLimit specified here and the sum of memory limits of all containers in a pod. from_secret \u00b6 import cdk8s_plus_22 cdk8s_plus_22 .

HttpIngressPathType \u00b6 Specify how the path is matched against request paths. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types PREFIX \u00b6 Matches the URL path exactly. EXACT \u00b6 Matches based on a URL path prefix split by \u2018/\u2019. IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC \u00b6 Matching is specified by the underlying IngressClass. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.

Service \u00b6 An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes you don\u2019t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with 3 replicas. Those replicas are fungible\u2014frontends do not care which backend they use. While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves. The Service abstraction enables this decoupling. If you\u2019re able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application, you can query the API server for Endpoints, that get updated whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes. For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

ServiceAccount \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-22.IServiceAccount A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default). https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account Initializers \u00b6 import { ServiceAccount } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' new ServiceAccount ( scope : Construct , id : string , props? : ServiceAccountProps ) scope Required \u00b6 Type: constructs.Construct id Required \u00b6 Type: string props Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.ServiceAccountProps Methods \u00b6 addSecret \u00b6 public addSecret ( secret : ISecret ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.ISecret The secret.

Returns a copy. To add a secret, use addSecret() . StatefulSet \u00b6 Implements: cdk8s-plus-22.IPodTemplate StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed. Using StatefulSets \u00b6 StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following. Stable, unique network identifiers. Stable, persistent storage. Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling. Ordered, automated rolling updates.

IngressRule \u00b6 Represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching path. Initializer \u00b6 import { IngressRule } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' const ingressRule : IngressRule = { ... } backend Required \u00b6 public readonly backend : IngressBackend ; Type: cdk8s-plus-22.IngressBackend Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to. host Optional \u00b6 public readonly host : string ; Type: string Default: If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue. Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \u201chost\u201d part of the URI as defined in the RFC: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The : delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. path Optional \u00b6 public readonly path : string ; Type: string Default: If unspecified, the path defaults to a catch all sending traffic to the backend. Path is an extended POSIX regex as defined by IEEE Std 1003.1, (i.e this follows the egrep/unix syntax, not the perl syntax) matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \u201cpath\u201d part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a \u2018/\u2019. pathType Optional \u00b6 public readonly pathType : HttpIngressPathType ; Type: cdk8s-plus-22.HttpIngressPathType Specify how the path is matched against request paths. By default, path types will be matched by prefix. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types IngressTls \u00b6 Represents the TLS configuration mapping that is passed to the ingress controller for SSL termination. Initializer \u00b6 import { IngressTls } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' const ingressTls : IngressTls = { ... } hosts Optional \u00b6 public readonly hosts : string []; Type: string [] Default: If unspecified, it defaults to the wildcard host setting for the loadbalancer controller fulfilling this Ingress.

The values in this list must match the name/s used in the TLS Secret. secret Optional \u00b6 public readonly secret : ISecret ; Type: cdk8s-plus-22.ISecret Default: If unspecified, it allows SSL routing based on SNI hostname. Secret is the secret that contains the certificate and key used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \u201cHost\u201d header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing.

Volume \u00b6 Volume represents a named volume in a pod that may be accessed by any container in the pod. Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes Initializers \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' new Volume ( name : string , config : any ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string config Required \u00b6 Type: any Static Functions \u00b6 fromConfigMap \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' Volume . fromConfigMap ( configMap : IConfigMap , options? : ConfigMapVolumeOptions ) configMap Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.IConfigMap The config map to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.ConfigMapVolumeOptions Options. fromEmptyDir \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' Volume . fromEmptyDir ( name : string , options? : EmptyDirVolumeOptions ) name Required \u00b6 Type: string options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.EmptyDirVolumeOptions Additional options. fromSecret \u00b6 import { Volume } from 'cdk8s-plus-22' Volume . fromSecret ( secret : ISecret , options? : SecretVolumeOptions ) secret Required \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.ISecret The secret to use to populate the volume. options Optional \u00b6 Type: cdk8s-plus-22.SecretVolumeOptions Options.

Enums \u00b6 EmptyDirMedium \u00b6 The medium on which to store the volume. DEFAULT \u00b6 The default volume of the backing node. MEMORY \u00b6 Mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead. While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on node reboot and any files you write will count against your Container\u2019s memory limit. EnvFieldPaths \u00b6 POD_NAME \u00b6 The name of the pod. POD_NAMESPACE \u00b6 The namespace of the pod. POD_UID \u00b6 The uid of the pod. POD_LABEL \u00b6 The labels of the pod.

NODE_IP \u00b6 The ipAddress of the node. POD_IPS \u00b6 The ipAddresess of the pod. HttpIngressPathType \u00b6 Specify how the path is matched against request paths. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types PREFIX \u00b6 Matches the URL path exactly. EXACT \u00b6 Matches based on a URL path prefix split by \u2018/\u2019. IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC \u00b6 Matching is specified by the underlying IngressClass. ImagePullPolicy \u00b6 ALWAYS \u00b6 Every time the kubelet launches a container, the kubelet queries the container image registry to resolve the name to an image digest. If the kubelet has a container image with that exact digest cached locally, the kubelet uses its cached image; otherwise, the kubelet downloads (pulls) the image with the resolved digest, and uses that image to launch the container. Default is Always if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and either the image tag is :latest or the image tag is omitted. IF_NOT_PRESENT \u00b6 The image is pulled only if it is not already present locally. Default is IfNotPresent if ImagePullPolicy is omitted and the image tag is present but not :latest NEVER \u00b6 The image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image. MountPropagation \u00b6 NONE \u00b6 This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host. In similar fashion, no mounts created by the Container will be visible on the host. This is the default mode. This mode is equal to private mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation HOST_TO_CONTAINER \u00b6 This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories. In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the Container will see it mounted there. Similarly, if any Pod with Bidirectional mount propagation to the same volume mounts anything there, the Container with HostToContainer mount propagation will see it. This mode is equal to rslave mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation BIDIRECTIONAL \u00b6 This volume mount behaves the same the HostToContainer mount. In addition, all volume mounts created by the Container will be propagated back to the host and to all Containers of all Pods that use the same volume A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a hostPath volume. This mode is equal to rshared mount propagation as described in the Linux kernel documentation Caution: Bidirectional mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged Containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended. In addition, any volume mounts created by Containers in Pods must be destroyed (unmounted) by the Containers on termination. PodManagementPolicy \u00b6 Controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is OrderedReady , where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is Parallel which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once. ORDERED_READY \u00b6 PARALLEL \u00b6 Protocol \u00b6 TCP \u00b6 UDP \u00b6 SCTP \u00b6 ResourceFieldPaths \u00b6 CPU_LIMIT \u00b6 CPU limit of the container. MEMORY_LIMIT \u00b6 Memory limit of the container. CPU_REQUEST \u00b6 CPU request of the container. MEMORY_REQUEST \u00b6 Memory request of the container. STORAGE_LIMIT \u00b6 Ephemeral storage limit of the container. STORAGE_REQUEST \u00b6 Ephemeral storage request of the container. RestartPolicy \u00b6 Restart policy for all containers within the pod. ALWAYS \u00b6 Always restart the pod after it exits. ON_FAILURE \u00b6 Only restart if the pod exits with a non-zero exit code. NEVER \u00b6 Never restart the pod. ServiceType \u00b6 For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a Service onto an external IP address, that\u2019s outside of your cluster. Kubernetes ServiceTypes allow you to specify what kind of Service you want. The default is ClusterIP. CLUSTER_IP \u00b6 Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the default ServiceType NODE_PORT \u00b6 Exposes the Service on each Node\u2019s IP at a static port (the NodePort). A ClusterIP Service, to which the NodePort Service routes, is automatically created. You\u2019ll be able to contact the NodePort Service, from outside the cluster, by requesting : . LOAD_BALANCER \u00b6 Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider\u2019s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP Services, to which the external load balancer routes, are automatically created. EXTERNAL_NAME \u00b6 Maps the Service to the contents of the externalName field (e.g. foo.bar.example.com), by returning a CNAME record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. Note: You need either kube-dns version 1.7 or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher to use the ExternalName type.","title":"TypeScript"},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/typescript/#cdk8s-plus-22-typescript","text":"","title":"cdk8s-plus-22 (TypeScript) "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/typescript/#constructs","text":"","title":"Constructs "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/typescript/#configmap","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-22.IConfigMap ConfigMap holds configuration data for pods to consume.","title":"ConfigMap "},{"location":"reference/cdk8s-plus-22/typescript/#deployment","text":"Implements: cdk8s-plus-22.IPodTemplate A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep track of the set of backends themselves.

Docker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container. Lifetimes are not managed and until very recently there were only local-disk-backed volumes. Docker now provides volume drivers, but the functionality is very limited for now (e.g. as of Docker 1.7 only one volume driver is allowed per Container and there is no way to pass parameters to volumes). A Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously. At its core, a volume is just a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the Containers in a Pod. How that directory comes to be, the medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular volume type used. To use a volume, a Pod specifies what volumes to provide for the Pod (the .spec.volumes field) and where to mount those into Containers (the .spec.containers[*].volumeMounts field). A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker image and volumes. The Docker image is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy, and any volumes are mounted at the specified paths within the image.
